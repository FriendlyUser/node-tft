### Node Tft

Typescript wrapper around the riot games api and utility functions so I can win more games of ranked tft.

#### Future Plans

1. Automatically Extract late game builds from grandmaster players
2. Display Useful statistics from games such as gold spent and other things.
3. Possibly useful for data science.
4. Pull Info from games I win and/or lose
5. Get a sense of how common certain builds are.
